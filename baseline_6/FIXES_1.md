# Baseline 6 Continual Learning Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **CWR* Implementation Problem** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The original CWR* implementation had a fundamental flaw where new class weights were initialized but then immediately overwritten with zero values from the CWR bank.

**Fix**: 
- Properly initialize CWR banks for new classes with small random values
- Restore weights from CWR bank for seen classes
- Update CWR bank with weighted average of current and stored weights
- Renormalize CWR bank weights to maintain unit norm

### 2. **Learning Rate Too High** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Learning rate of 0.1 was extremely high for classifier training, causing unstable training and poor convergence.

**Fix**: Reduced learning rate from 0.1 to 0.01

### 3. **Feature Normalization Issues** (IMPORTANT)
**Problem**: Features were being normalized twice (in extract_latent and classify), causing numerical instability.

**Fix**: Only normalize features once in the classify function

### 4. **Classifier Initialization** (IMPORTANT)
**Problem**: Classifier weights weren't properly initialized, leading to poor initial performance.

**Fix**: Added proper weight initialization with small random values and zero bias

### 5. **Loss Function** (MINOR)
**Problem**: Standard CrossEntropyLoss without regularization could lead to overfitting.

**Fix**: Added label smoothing (0.1) for better training stability

## Configuration Changes

```yaml
# Before
learning_rate: 0.1
CWR: False

# After  
learning_rate: 0.01
CWR: True
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Learning**: The reduced learning rate should allow the model to learn more stably
2. **Reduced Catastrophic Forgetting**: CWR* should help preserve knowledge of previous tasks
3. **Improved New Class Learning**: Proper initialization and normalization should help with learning new classes
4. **More Stable Training**: Label smoothing and proper normalization should reduce training instability

## Additional Recommendations

### For Further Improvement:

1. **Increase Training Epochs**: Consider increasing from 3 to 5-10 epochs for better convergence
2. **Adjust Replay Buffer Size**: The current 1000 samples might be too small for 10 classes
3. **Experiment with Alpha**: Try different values (0.3, 0.7) for the CWR* alpha parameter
4. **Add Learning Rate Scheduling**: Consider using a learning rate scheduler
5. **Monitor Gradient Norms**: Add gradient clipping if gradients become too large

### For TinyML Optimization:

1. **Quantize Classifier**: The classifier is still in FP32 - consider quantizing to INT8
2. **Reduce Replay Buffer**: For very constrained devices, reduce replay buffer size
3. **Use Smaller Batch Sizes**: Consider live_batch=20, replay_batch=30 for memory efficiency

## Testing

Run the test script to verify fixes:
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the training with these fixes
2. Monitor the results - you should see:
   - Higher accuracy on new tasks
   - Less forgetting of previous tasks
   - More stable training curves
3. If performance is still poor, consider the additional recommendations above
4. Once this baseline works, you can proceed with implementing pruning strategies from the SparCL and Structured Sparse papers
