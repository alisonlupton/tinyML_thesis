# Progressive Replay Strategy for Continual Learning

## Problem Solved
- **New classes not learning**: Fixed by reducing replay interference
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: Addressed by progressive replay increase
- **Imbalanced learning**: Solved by weighted loss and balanced sampling

## Strategy Overview

### 1. **Progressive Replay Ratios**
- **Epoch 0**: 10% replay (minimal interference for new classes)
- **Epoch 1**: 30% replay (moderate balance)
- **Epoch 2**: 50% replay (strong retention)

### 2. **Balanced Sampling**
- Equal samples from each available class
- Prevents any single class from dominating
- Ensures fair representation of all seen classes

### 3. **Weighted Loss Function**
- **Live data**: Full weight (1.0)
- **Replay data**: Half weight (0.5)
- Prevents replay from overwhelming new learning

### 4. **Conservative CWR***
- **Alpha**: 0.3 (more conservative than 0.5)
- Only applies to previously trained classes
- Prevents interference with new class learning

## Key Features

### **Adaptive Replay**
```python
if epoch == 0:
    replay_ratio = 0.1  # Minimal replay
elif epoch == 1:
    replay_ratio = 0.3  # Moderate replay
else:
    replay_ratio = 0.5  # Full replay
```

### **Balanced Sampling**
```python
samples_per_class = max(1, effective_replay_batch // len(available_classes))
for c in available_classes:
    actual_samples = min(samples_per_class, len(classwise_feats[c]))
```

### **Weighted Loss**
```python
total_loss = live_loss + 0.5 * replay_loss
```

## Expected Results

1. **Task 1 Learning**: Should achieve >60% accuracy (like without replay)
2. **Task 0 Retention**: Should maintain >50% accuracy (preventing forgetting)
3. **Balanced Performance**: Both old and new classes should perform well
4. **Stable Training**: Gradual replay increase prevents sudden interference

## Monitoring

- **Replay usage**: Track which classes are being replayed
- **Loss components**: Monitor live vs replay loss
- **Accuracy per task**: Ensure both learning and retention
- **Prediction distribution**: Check for balanced predictions

## Next Steps

1. Run training with this strategy
2. Monitor results for both learning and retention
3. Adjust ratios if needed (replay_ratio, loss_weight, alpha)
4. Fine-tune for optimal balance
