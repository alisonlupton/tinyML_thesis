# Still implemented basic model with CL  
PTQ and unstructured pruning (50%) still used, continuing from baseline_1, not much changed with the model.  
I only measured avalanche with batch size 2, replay size 200. This achieved very good accuracy with just the basic adapter
head and simple replay. Next steps are to try new datasets, and start implementing on tflite so that I'm able to get better 
measurments of space. Assuming accuracy drops and space becomes an issue I will test out more complex strategies. The novel part of this baseline is nailing down the metric measurments for continual learning, found in CL_metrics_extended.csv
